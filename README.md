## Running codes
Put codes in `train/` folder, with a separate folder for each subject
- Run `errp_riemann.ipynb` for running the baseline (state-of-the-art) results
- Run `errp_proposed.ipynb` for running the proposed algorithm

Note:
1. Choose `flag_test=False` for running 10-fold CV results (Paper includes only 10-fold CV)

## Data Analysis
All the results and analysis is in `data_analysis/` folder
